## 💡 Key Business Insights
Based on the data analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:
* **Target Audience:** The highest conversion rates were found among **Students** and **Retirees**. Working-age adults (30-50) showed lower interest.
* **Engagement Matters:** There is a direct correlation between call duration and success. Successful calls averaged ~8 minutes, while failed calls averaged ~3 minutes.
* **History Repeats:** Customers who successfully subscribed in previous campaigns had a **60-70%** chance of subscribing again (Retention is key).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
